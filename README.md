From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

Project to make a mock up google webpage.

Project is mostly finished. Will likely return after I'm become more experienced to improve this project. Currently, I've vastly improved in most of my CSS capabilities. Building something from scratch is very different than follow online guidance for most projects. Besides CSS, I probably learned the most about utilizing nav bars and fixing them in place. Absolutely improved most in thatt area.
